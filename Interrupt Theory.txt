Interrupt Theory

Types:-
1. External - Reset,INT0,INT1,INT2
2. Internal - Timer 0,1,2,ADC,USART, Comparator etc.

Registers:-
1. SREG - 1 bit
2. MCUCR 
3. MCUCSR
4. GICR
5. GIFR

Interrupt Code:-
Header File: #include <avr/interrupt.h>

Functions:-
sei() - to set
cei()	- to reset
	
Some Code:-

1. The main execution routine in ATMEGA16 (code executes when interrupt occurs) :-

ISR (INTO_vect)  //Don't mention any return type for ISR
{
	PORTB=0xf0;
	_delay_ms(1000);
}

Programming steps:-

1. Clear the global interrupt pin using cli() function.
2. Configure the specific registers for the interrupt enable MCUCR,MCUCSR,GICR.	
3. Set the global interrupt bit in set registers.
4. Write the specific interrupt service routine in defined format.

Hence:-

#include<avr/interrupt.h>

ISR (INTO_vect) 
{
	PORTB=0xf0;
	_delay_ms(1000);
}

void main()
{
	DDRB=0xff;
	cli();
	MCUCR=0x00;
	GICR=0x40;
	sei();
	while(1)
	{
		PORTB=0x0f;
		_delay_ms(1000); 
		}
}

* The loop gets executed continuously but when any switch on the microcontoller is pressed then the ISR routine(interrupt) gets called.*

USART

Its a type of wireless communication done serially.

Radio frequency(RF) of 434 MHz is unlicensed frequency.

RX - HT12D ( D stands for decoding the data i.e. a decoder)
TX - HT12E ( E stands for encoding the data i.e. an encoder) 

A DIP switch is used on transmitter to select a channel for transmission (having specific channel id).
The above ICs (modules) are ASIC ( Application Specific Integrated Circuit ).

Transmission of a frame is called baud rate. A frame is a collection of all data bits and some extra bits.

The rate of change of data bits is called data rate.
